        <h2>Resolution for Supporting a Growing YDSA</h2>
        <p>
          YDSA now has more than 130 chapters. YDSA blossoming isn&rsquo;t just
          a result of socialism&rsquo;s rise in popularity; it&rsquo;s also a
          product of the hard work by young student organizers all across the
          country. But YDSA only has two staffers for all of these chapters and
          we&rsquo;re running up against the limit of what volunteer labor can
          do. More staff could mean more chapters, more training for new
          members, and more productive national committees.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            We hope that some changes will make our annual conventions more
            meaningful by better allowing elected leaders to carry out the
            delegates&rsquo; democratic decisions.
          </strong>{" "}
          Allowing National Coordinating Committee members to have input in the
          hiring process and budgetary decisions would expand capacity and
          enable elected leadership to better determine the direction of our
          organization. Stipends for NCC members would allow them to focus on
          YDSA organizing for the year, instead of splitting time between school
          and a job. Finally, inviting National Coordinating Committee members
          to participate in National Political Committee meetings would improve
          coordination between YDSA and the rest of the DSA. Together, these
          proposals can transform YDSA into the prominent nationwide student
          organization that it has the potential to be.

        <h2>College for All</h2>
        <p>
          YDSA needs a national campaign. When our leaders, committees, and
          chapters are all working together, our collective energy is focused.
          During the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, our objective was
          clear: go all in and build YDSA in the process. Sanders&rsquo;s
          policies were easy to understand and widely popular because they would
          take money and power from the rich and put it in the hands of working
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently, Sanders and Pramila Jayapal have reintroduced their College
          for All bill, giving YDSA the opportunity to fight for debt- and
          tuition-free higher education. We should seize the moment, with the
          understanding that winning College for All will require mass action,
          not just politicking by elected officials.{" "}
          <strong>
            The previous College for All campaign helped build YDSA into the
            nationwide organization it is today. Now YDSA can be the
            organization that millions of young people associate with the fight
            for fully-funded and affordable education.
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapters at Kenyon, UVA, and Columbia led mass campaigns that
          organized and politicized thousands of students and student-workers.
          We want to strengthen this local work by providing more national
          support for chapters&rsquo; campaigns and connecting it to our
          national campaign and a broader socialist vision for education.

        <h2>Expanding YDSA’s Rank-and-File Pipeline</h2>
        <p>
          Workers’ vital power comes from the ability to disrupt profits. Last
          convention, YDSA delegates reaffirmed our commitment to the
          rank-and-file strategy by voting to form a “rank-and-file pipeline”
          that would educate members about labor history and prepare them to be
          shop-floor organizers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            In the last year, hundreds of students have attended National Labor
            Committee trainings and expressed interest in joining the labor
            movement after they graduate.
          </strong>{" "}
          Cohering a socialist layer in the labor movement will take time, an
          investment that will pay off in the future with thousands of
          class-conscious militants fighting back all across the country. We
          must continue this work further, which is why Bread and Roses YDSA is
          supporting the National Labor Committee’s resolution on Expanding
          YDSA’s Rank-and-File Pipeline.

        <h2>Strengthening YDSA’s Political Education Program</h2>
        <p>
          Political education is a key component of YDSA’s central task of
          cultivating lifelong socialist organizers. Political education equips
          our members with the skills necessary to bring socialist politics to a
          wider audience as well as to engage in strategic analysis of our
          society and to use those insights to inform our organizing.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past year the National Political Education Committee has hosted
          multiple reading groups attended by dozens of chapters and hundreds of
          members. This type of discussion-based political education creates a
          shared sense of solidarity despite distance and develops skills that
          organizers can bring back to their own chapters. The National
          Political Education Committee also developed a curriculum for chapters
          to use, hosted trainings to support chapters with local political
          education, drafted a Tasks &amp; Perspectives document, and
          facilitated nationwide and local discussions about our strategy for
          winning socialism.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            We should continue this political education by facilitating more
            regional events to kickstart new chapters and encourage
            cross-chapter collaboration, as well as introducing a comprehensive
            new member onboarding that will help us to more effectively support
            and develop new socialist cadre.
          </strong>{" "}
          That’s why Bread and Roses YDSA is supporting the National Political
          Education Committee’s resolution on Strengthening YDSA’s Political
          Education Program.

        <h2>Building a YDSA Mentorship Program</h2>
        <p>
          As young people part of a relatively young socialist movement, we have
          a lot to learn. In places like New York City and East Bay, older and
          more experienced DSA and YDSA members have used mentorship programs to
          build new chapters and develop new leaders, especially at schools with
          multiracial, working-class student populations.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are already some chapters with mentorship positions or official
          connections with their local DSA chapters. But these relationships
          should be standardized into a national mentorship team. By creating a
          special mentorship curriculum and coordinating nationally,{" "}
          <strong>
            YDSA can learn from the previous generation of socialist leaders in
            order to support the next generation
          </strong>
          .
